                This is a distributed service. So, The cloud platform is responsible for receiving the data from any plugins that build for this service and also able to sending data. The system will have a feature to integrate with other third party applications (like Moodle). So the constants will be: For service we are using .Net Framework, we will use Django (a python framework) for cloud platform, for ios we use swift and for android we use Java programming language. And for Moddle we use Php.

                User can use the service from two places. They can use it from our website or they can edit their document by signing on Moodle.
                <p><strong>Website:</strong> A user needs to sign up to DTS to get the DTS service. After signing up, the user has to upload any documents that he/she wants to tag and then can publish the documents to others.</P>
                <p><strong>Moodle:</strong> DTS comes with Moodle plugin. So all DTS users can get the full DTS service in Moodle environment.</p>

              <strong>User Interface</strong>
              <p>
                There will be three type of user interfaces. These interfaces required characteristics between our software and our user. For our user interfaces we will use bootstrap material UI in Django and for the backend we will use .NET. Three types of interfaces are:
                <ol>

                    <strong>Moodle Plugin</strong>
                    </br><p>For this interface we will use our ULAB Moodle's basic interfaces. This interface plugin will be on PHP. In moodle we use an editor for PDF, it's Moodle  editor for annotation. In this editor, there is some awesome features. There will some button with some amazing features. Some features be like: </p>
                    <ol>

                        <strong>Add tag:</strong>
                        </br><p>There will some default tag for the user's to use. User can add some tag too by their own choice. Just he/she needs to select some text and tag. We will provide some features like tag color, some icon to use as a tag etc.</p>
                      </li>
                      <li id = "Comment Tag">

                    <p>Like web application and iOS application a user also can have our android application in his/her smartphone. It's interface will be same as web application(web view) and iOS application so that user can understand it easily. Also users can  upload and annonate PDF files from android application and all the options web application and iOS application have.

              <strong>Hardware Interface</strong>
              <p>
                In hardware interface, at first we need to know how many user will use this system and how big the database will. It relies on that the system, which will require a database to store data. If there's some problems occur while the user to tag the document in-case of load shedding or bad Internet connection, our database should have backup capabilities. After that the system will automatically synchronize data from the user. For this interface it requires windows machine for client application, Ubuntu machine for web application and Moodle plug in.
              </p>
            </li>

              <strong>Software Interface</strong>
              <p>
                For software interface, we will use Moodle as a software. Moodle's basic interface will use for this. And we will use Moodle our software and interface. There will be a moodle interface and user will set those rules or PDF. For the view of our web application we will use web browser. The rest will be same as hardware interface.
              </p>

            <li id="Communication_Interface">
              <strong>Communication Interface</strong>
              <p>
                The system is hosted on a server name Microsoft Azure. So, it need HTTP protocol to communicate with the server. We will use our main service API to communicate our applications. Communication between the user and the system can be established through our interfaces. The data transfer rate in our database will be on normal process. We will use browser and for every possible step the asynchronous synchronization process is available for the user. If any problem occurs no data will get lost in our system. For the better communication we will use third party authentication system. User can logged in our system via gmail, face-book, linked-in, twitter and etc. This system has the permission to access in all popular web browsers that can interact with HTML pages. The users can communicate via http/https (port: 80/443) connection and the client will also need to communicate via http/https(port: 80/443) connection.

                Our service is user friendly and reliable. Our main service(.NET) is connected with moodle, android, iOS and also with web. Performance will measure by user's CPU (Central Processing Unit), internet connection speed. But main performance (run time) of our backend service is very sufficient. Our service can take those tags in servers at a real time. Since our service will be connected to every applications(web, moodle, iOS, android), so our service design that way so that it can done its work properly and efficiently.
                <br> A user shouldn't be worry about our service performance. An admin person can create a user or client, in that case our service will take care of performance of admin users or clients. If user work online then data will be saved in real time and save those data in cloud. Our service will be integrated with third party software (with permission) and it's performance will be same reliable.

                A user can sign in our system by many ways. It can be our service verification or oAuth or Single sign-on (SSO) for verification or credential. So a user should not be worry about their security.
                Credentials will be safe and sound in our service. <br>
                Also for authorization our service will take care of authorization of every user. A user should not be worry about our service authorization and can give restrictions on users. Restriction can be view, edit, view and edit etc. So it will be handle as usual.      
                <br>At the end, every safety and security is maintain good so user shouldn't worry about authentication and authorization.

              <strong> Software Quality Attributes</strong>
              <p>
                Software quality attributes specify the required reliability, availability, security, maintainability, robustness, portability of the software system. <br> <br>

                <strong>Reliability: </strong> The system should able to run continuously a long duration of time and not suffer from system slowdowns or crashes for memory leaks. <br> <br>

                <strong>Availability: </strong> The information can be send again for verification if the internet service lost during sending information to server. <br> <br>

                <strong>Security: </strong> Unauthorized access to the system and its data is not allowed. Secure the communication between the system and server. <br> <br>

                <strong>Maintainability: </strong> The application should be easy to extend, so in order for future functions to be implemented easily to the application. The code should be indicted in a way that it favors implementation of incipient functions. <br> <br>

                <strong>Robustness: </strong> The system is need to enough robust to successful a transaction and ability of a system to cope with errors during execution. <br> <br>

                <strong>Portability: </strong> The software should be able to run on any Microsoft windows predicated platform.
